# Waze Machine Learning Project

This project applies **Machine Learning** techniques on the **Waze dataset** to analyze user behavior and predict key outcomes.  
The main focus is on building predictive models using **Random Forest** and **XGBoost**, supported by data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA).

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset contains Waze user activity information, including engagement and retention metrics.  
(Note: The dataset is not publicly shared here due to privacy reasons.)

## ⚙️ Project Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values
   - Feature transformation and encoding

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Statistical summaries
   - Data visualization to understand user behavior

3. **Model Development**
   - **Random Forest**
   - **XGBoost**
   - Cross-validation for reliable evaluation

4. **Evaluation**
   - Compared model performances
   - Selected best-performing approach

## ✅ Results
- Identified important features for predicting user retention
- Random Forest and XGBoost compared with cross-validation
- XGBoost achieved better generalization (details in notebook)

## 🚀 Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- Jupyter Notebook
